# Prompt
This is just a crash course on all the javascript syntax we've learned so far. In this crash course, I will be limiting the hints ðŸ˜Ž

# Basic problems
1. Imagine you have a number. Lets say `5`. How can you tell whether this number is odd?
<details>
  <summary>Hints (dont look unless you're really stuck)</summary>

  You can use these two choices interchangably. I like to typically use the second choice just for more readability. In reality there's no difference
  ```js
  const num = 5;
  
  // first choice. just console.log the value
  console.log(num % 2 === 1); // true
  
  // second choice. assign the value to a variable
  const numIsOdd = num % 2 === 1;
  console.log(numIsOdd); // true
  ```
</details>

2. If the number is odd, lets just `console.log('Num is odd!')`. How would you do that?
- if statements ONLY run if the logic is `true`
```js
if (true) {
  // this will run
}

if (false) {
  // this will not run
}
```
You can replace `true` / `false` with some logic. For example,
```js
if (3 < 5) {
  // this will run because 3 < 5 evaluates to true
}

if (3 > 5) {
  // this will not run because 3 > 5 evaluates to false
}

if (!(3 > 5)) {
  // this will run because 3 > 5 evaluates to false. we use ! to invert the false, so !false becomes true
}
```

  <summary>Hints (dont look unless you're really stuck)</summary>

  You can use these two choices interchangably. I like to typically use the second choice just for more readability. In reality there's no difference
  ```js
  const num = 5;
  
  // first choice. just check the value within the if statement
  if (num % 2 === 1) {
    console.log('num is odd');
  }
  
  // second choice. assign the value to a variable
  const numIsOdd = num % 2 === 1;
  if (numIsOdd) {
    console.log('num is odd');
  }
  ```
</details>

3. Imagine you have a bag of colors. Lets say you have the colors 'red', 'blue', 'green', 'orange', 'yellow'. How can you store all these colors in your code?  
  
you should NOT do   
```js
const red = 'red';
const blue = 'blue';
const green = 'green';
const orange = 'orange';
const yellow = 'yellow';
```

<details>
  <summary>Hints (dont look unless you're really stuck)</summary>
  
  Use an array
  
  ```js
  const colors = ['red', 'blue', 'green', 'orange', 'yellow'];
  ```
</details>

4. We have stored all the colors in our code inside a variable. How can you access the 0th element? What about the 1st element? What about the 2nd element? Lets just console.log it one by one

<details>
  <summary>Hint</summary>
  
  ```js
  const colors = ['red', 'blue', 'green', 'orange', 'yellow'];
  console.log(colors[0]); // access the 0th color
  console.log(colors[1]); // access the 1st color
  console.log(colors[2]); // access the 2nd color
  ```
</details>

5. How can you look through every single color one by one? No hints!
6. For each of the colors that you have stored, how many colors are longer than 3 characters? You're gonna need a counter variable for this. 
  
something like 
```js
let numberOfColorsThatAreOddLength = 0;

......

const color = 'red';
console.log(color.length); // 3. this is how you get the # of characters in a string

if (color.length > 3) {
  numberOfColorsThatAreOddLength++;
}

```
7. You have a bottle of alcohol. This bottle of alcohol has a few properties
- The bottle name: casamigos
- The spirit: tequila
- The alcohol percentage: 40%
- Number of shots until blackout: 20

Without storing these properties into individual variables like this, how can you store this information in your code?
```js
const name = 'casamigos';
const spirit = 'tequila';
const percentage = 0.4;
const shotsUntilBlackout = 20;
```

8. Nice! You stored the information in your code. How can you programmatically access the `name`, `spirit`, `percentage`, and `shotsUntilBlackout` properties? Lets just console.log all of them
9. If the percentage is greater than 0.3, lets `console.log('This is a courtney style drink')`

# Slightly more advanced problems
10. Remember how in the 7th problem, you only had to deal with 1 bottle? What if you have many different bottles? Lets store this information in our code.
Lets store your favorite 3 bottles now.

  <summary>Hints (dont look unless you're really stuck)</summary>
  
  Previously, we made an array of strings. We had    
  
  ```js
  const colors = ['red', 'blue', 'green', 'orange', 'yellow'];
  ```
  
  colors[0] is 'red'.  
  colors[1] is 'blue'.  
  colors[2] is 'green'.  
  and so on.    
  
  ---
    
  You can have an array of objects.  
  
  ```js
  const bottles = [
    {name: 'casamigos', spirit: 'tequila', percentage: 0.4, shotsUntilBlackout: 20},
    {name: 'malibu', spirit: 'liqueur', percentage: 0.21, shotsUntilBlackout: 40},
    {name: 'black label', spirit: 'whiskey', percentage: 0.4, shotsUntilBlackout: 15},
  ];
  ```
  
  bottles[0] is {name: 'casamigos', spirit: 'tequila', percentage: 0.4, shotsUntilBlackout: 20}.  
  bottles[1] is {name: 'malibu', spirit: 'liqueur', percentage: 0.21, shotsUntilBlackout: 40}.  
  and so on.  
</details>

11. How can you access the `percentage` property from every single bottle you have? Lets just console.log the percentage of every single bottle, one by one
12. Find the # of bottles with percentage less than 0.3 and console.log it

# Back to basics
13. Imagine you have an array of numbers. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. You want to find the average of all those numbers. Write me some code that finds the average and console.logs the average
14. Imagine you have a second array of numbers. [4, 5, 6, 7, 1, 2]. You want to also find the average of all those numbers. Write me some code that finds the average and console.logs it
15. Imagine you have a third array of numbers. [10, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2]. You want to also find the average of all those numbers. Write me some code that finds the average and console.logs it
16. Imagine you have a fourth array of numbers. [100, 12, 1, 3, 4]. You want to also find the average of all those numbers. Write me some code that finds the average and console.logs it
17. Imagine you have a fifth array of numbers. [1, 100, 2, 19, 3]. You want to also find the average of all those numbers. Write me some code that finds the average and console.logs it
